# Clash Builder Base Resource Farmer
Hi, note that you will have to adjust all positions (x,y coordinates) to fit your computer screen, as this code isn't adaptable (I'm lazy.)
Created on python 3.7.1 using Bluestacks 10.0.20.1013 - pie 64 bit to run clash, pip install pyautogui to run :), good luck!
